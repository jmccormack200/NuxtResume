        "feedback": `JD's work is currently bringing our Android craft to the next level.
    A lot of our reference material for how to build an Android app architecture and 
    thus implementations in our current projects have fallen behind the direction the 
    Android ecosystem has been heading in. On several client projects, JD has truly 
    updated and refined our approach with the most recent iteration now being built out 
    as a sample base project that all of our future projects will reference. He has brought 
    scale to our development process that has only really been talked about amongst our craft 
    team and not yet proven out in the form of multi module development. 
    JD's deep technical well of knowledge combined with his right instincts helped craft a modern 
    Android architecture that is vastly improved over the ideas and implementations we've done thus far. 
    On top of that, his team building and presentation skills brought that knowledge across our whole team 
    so everyone is invested in this new approach.`

        feedback: `JD was awesome in assisting on solutioning for 
        one of our new opportunities, helping us generate estimates 
        and a solution staffing plan for the middleware component, 
        as well as responding rapidly to multiple changes in scope and 
        direction. He went above and beyond with his responsiveness and 
        willingness to walk the account team through our estimates so they 
        better understood the solution and were able to speak to it with the client.`

        feedback: `I've had the pleasure of working with JD for the past few years and
         was thrilled to staff him on a new client program this winter. 
         On our program, JD led the Android team. The engagement was both technically complex (AR prototyping, bluetooth architecture) 
         and required significant cross-program collaboration. 
         JD architected a scalable framework for future development work which he presented to the client to
          showcase the cutting edge nature of the project. 
          JD provided a point of view on the current landscape for AR on Android 
          and helped the client choose the best approach. 
          The piece that stood out to me the most is JD's comfort in uncertainty and ambiguity. 
          He is very comfortable and skilled at learning new languages, at researching industry/technical 
          trends and then bringing an educated POV back to clients.
           It made me extremely confident in our team's ability knowing that JD was there and 
           able to adapt/respond to any technical questions thrown at him. 
           The client's stakeholders saw JD as a clear resource 
           for technical architecture solutions.`

        feedback: `JD was a GODSEND on our project. The goal of this engagement was 
        to add new features and address bugs carried over from the original release, 
        but the Android backlog was significantly bigger than iOS and made it almost impossible
        to achieve feature parity. On top of that, the bugs were pretty complex and we had a junior dev 
        staffed on the project. He jumped in unofficially to mentor and support our Android dev on his “free time” 
        while working on another project. Once we recognized that we would not be able to complete the Android work, 
        much less catch up to iOS, he joined the team and helped us get back on track. 
        Within a sprint, JD cleared the backlog and whipped the app into shape, 
        while also mentoring the junior dev through their tickets. In addition to all dev work, 
        he was crucial in resolving major blockers with the client's DevOps pipeline. He’s fast, thorough, and
         very communicative – keeping his tickets updated, raising and addressing blockers as they arise, 
         and jumping in to support other devs (or PM :D) as needed.`

        author: "Lead Designer",
        feedback: `I worked with JD on a client project starting in January 2020. 
        JD was extremely responsive and helpful whenever design had questions or 
        needed more information about something. He was active in conversations 
        with design and development together and gave valuable insight and information
         as we worked through issues together. On more than one occasion, he went above 
         and beyond to demo how something worked for us or walk us through a process, 
         which was instrumental as we worked to understand how the system we were designing needed to function. 
        I would be very happy to work on a project with JD again!`
