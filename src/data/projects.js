        medical data platform. On the first phase of the project, I helped build a 
        component library that other teams could use to speed up development. I set up 
        a CI/CD pipeline to help distribute the library and maintain documentation. I helped
        the team adapt to requests for new features from developers. I also upskilled both mobile and offshore
        developers in vue.js in a short period of time. I have since moved to a new work stream to help build out a new data tool using Vue and Vuex.

        I helped define a modern Android architecture using clean architecture principles. I prototyped virtual try on features using
        the Google ARCore library in both Android and Unity. The app was designed to connect to and control a wearable device and made
        extensive use of bluetooth libraries. This project was put on hold due to cost cutting measures related to COVID.

        while implementing cutting edge features such as biometrics and deep linking.`,

        description: `
            I led the development of a major international hotel chain's app rebuild. 
            I worked on the development process from the solution stage all the way to delivery.  
            I wrote the entire base architecture that the app lives on top of. 
            The architecture used for this project is considered bleeding edge and utilizes numerous
             android frameworks that had existed for less than a year. 
             It is extremely scalable, well tested, and designed to support the large team 
             that will ultimately build the app. 
             The setup and planning I did on this project helped drive phase two of the project, 
             a contract sized at over $5.5 Million. 
             In addition to the work done to setup the project, I provided guidance to managing directors about alternatives 
             to rebuilding from scratch when there were timeline constraints that could impact delivery. This project
             was temporarily put on hold due to COVID.

        system for improving the safety of cranes on offshore oil rigs. Used Unity3D to build
        a simulation of a working crane that could be used to calculate the position of the crane load
        based on sensors input from an actual crane. Developed a web app to integrate with an Ultra Wide Band (UWB)
        positioning system to determine if a worker was walking too close to the crane in order to alert them of the danger.
        This project was a finalist for the NSC Green Cross safety award.`,
